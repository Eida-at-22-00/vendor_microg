# üì¶ microG Variant Support for AxionAOSP

This repository adds official support for a **microG variant** in [AxionAOSP](https://github.com/AxionAOSP), enabling users to build ROMs with microG instead of Google Play Services. Ideal for privacy-conscious users who still want push notifications and app compatibility.
